# Image-Classification-using-Hashing-Techniques-and-Relevance-Feedback
Images are labeled image-X-Y-Z.png, where â€“ X (cc, con, emboss, jitter, neg, noise1, noise2, original, poster, rot, smooth, stipple) specifies the image type, Y denotes the subject ID in range [1-40], and Z denotes the image sample ID [1-10]. The three feature models and similarity/distance functions generated in the previous phase are used in this phase's tasks. Various dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Singular Value Decomposition, K-means clustering are applied to the extracted features. Then we use a classifier such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Personalized Pagerank to classify images. Another approach uses Hashing Techniques like Locality Sensitive Hashing and Vector Approximation files along with K-nearest neighbors to extract similar images.
